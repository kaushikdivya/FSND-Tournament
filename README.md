# FSND-Tournament

## Description
In this project, Python module uses the PostgreSQL database to keep track of players and matches in a game tournament.

The game tournament uses the Swiss system for pairing up players in each round: players are not eliminated, and each player should be paired with another player with the same number of wins, or as close as possible.

This project has two parts: defining the database schema (SQL table definitions), and writing the code that will use it.
